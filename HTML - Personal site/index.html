                        <p><em>HR Business Partner (IT) of <strong>Grip Digital games studio</strong></em></p>
                        <p>I have always been enthusiastic in IT from childhood, when I played video game and when something went wrong I tryed to fix it. 
                            From fixing issues in computer I learnt so much from it. I found passion with computers and SW. 
                            But I have never thought that is possible to move in IT industry as programmer, I always underestimate myself I am not good to be IT guy. 
                            So I chose to be IT recruiter. I started as IT researcher in HR, then I move on IT recruiter position and finally on HR Team leader of IT team. 
                            In this moment I have been working for Grip Digital (Game Studio company), where I am more in touch with developers of different skills such as: C++, C#, IT admin, Python etc. 
                            Also, working in game industry was my dream. From this perspective I stay in touch with IT world and I found passion to write code.
